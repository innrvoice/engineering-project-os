# Mobile capability pack

Apply this pack to native or cross-platform applications, including their device lifecycle and system
handoffs.

- Treat cold start, foreground, background, suspension, unlock, navigation focus, and process restart as
  distinct entry conditions when they can change the outcome.
- Model permissions, camera, files, notifications, share sheets, deep links, system settings, and other
  external surfaces as owned operation phases rather than ordinary synchronous calls.
- Bind async work, cached data, durable intents, files, and cleanup to their initiating account, route,
  entity, or generation. Cancellation of UI interest does not undo remote work.
- Separate JavaScript or shared-code tests from native runtime, installed artifact, and physical-device
  evidence. Verify each affected platform independently.
- Keep platform-specific workarounds narrow, version-bounded, and removable. Do not impose one mobile
  framework's architecture on another.
